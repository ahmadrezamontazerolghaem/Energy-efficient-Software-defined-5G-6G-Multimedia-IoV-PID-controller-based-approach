Energy-efficient Software-defined 5G/6G Multimedia IoV: PID controller-based approach:

The rapid proliferation of multimedia applications in smart city environments and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) presents significant challenges for existing network infrastructures, particularly with the advent of 5G and emerging 6G technologies. Traditional architectures struggle to meet the demands for scalability, adaptability, and energy efficiency required by data-intensive multimedia services. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative, energy-efficient framework for multimedia resource management in software-defined 5G/6G IoV networks, leveraging a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The framework integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) technologies to enable centralized and adaptive control over network resources. By employing a PID controller, it dynamically manages load distribution and temperature, ensuring balanced resource allocation and minimizing energy waste. Comprehensive simulations validate the frameworkâ€™s effectiveness, demonstrating significant improvements in load balancing, CPU utilization, and energy consumption compared to traditional methods. For instance, under heavy traffic conditions, the proposed framework maintained resource efficiency, reducing power consumption by up to $30\%$ and achieving nearly equal load distribution across all network components. Additionally, the controller exhibited exceptional scalability, effectively responding to over $98\%$ of vehicle requests even in scenarios of extreme traffic demand.
